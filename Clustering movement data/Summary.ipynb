Though some provided a clear separation in the data (namely: Normal Quantile Transform), the separation was not informative in terms of two distinct clusters, one representing large motion and the other representing noise. The first image below shows what would hopefully be the two clusters... the second shows what 'significant movements' vs. 'noise' roughly is.\n",

    "Testing data generated by Ignacio (IOT-111 under sub-directory individual-movemens) was used to find the best parameters for the iForest algorithm. The movements in question are summarised as a comment on IOT-111. There are a total of 9 movements, each of which is either 'significant' or 'insignifcant'. Note that the significant ones will have a percentage of insignificant movements in them, just by nature of how the data was collected. However, since it is impossible to pinpoint which points are significant and which aren't without imposing a certain bias into the data, 'significant' movement datasets were deemed to contain 100% significant movements. **This is one of the reasons for the accuracy being low.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data, the best model was as follows:\n",
    "Isolation Forest with a *contamination* of **0.054**, *max_features* of **1**, *n_estimators* of **100**. Note that larger value for *n_estimators* may actually be more accurate (however it may also overfit the data). \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Note that the separation creates an L-shape as opposed to a reciprocal graph (which is what you would most likely expect - in fact a previous iteration with a smaller dataset created just that!). It might be worth looking into why this may be: it could just be that more data --> more concentration of points that are stationary, hence the L-shape is more defined. An ideal algorithm would probably create the reciprocal curve.\n",
    "2. The algorithm is not perfect, as on the RHS you can see some points with a very high gyration that are labelled as 'insignificant', when they may actually be\n",

    "b) more data from many different people (to ensure that the model is robust)\n",

    "Seeing as the L-shape is *somewhat* representative of a reciprocal curve, it was decided to plot $a_ia_i$ vs. $\\frac{1}{\\omega_i\\omega_i}$ to see if the separation boundary can be modelled using a polynomial.\n",

    "To approximate this, an arbitrary model of $p(x) = ax^4 + bx^2 + cx + d$ (where $x$ here represents $\\frac{1}{\\omega_i\\omega_i}$) was chosen. One must not assume that this is the best model; it was chosen because it seemed to represent the curve well, and there was little time to spend on finding the best model.\n",
